Are you looking for high quality, personalized tutoring in math or physics? Then you've come to the right place! I founded Resonance Tutoring with the philosophy that the best learning happens when the student and teacher can come together and truly understand each other's perspectives. 

In physics, resonance refers to the observation that in certains types of systems, applying a force at one particular frequency will produce a strong effect, while forcing the system at any other frequency will have a much smaller effect. As an intuitive example, think about playing on a swing. In order to get the swing to move in a large arc, you need to pump your legs in time with the swing's motion. If you pump your legs randomly or at a frequency that is off from the swing's, then the swing will slow down and you won't travel as far. 

In my years of teaching, I've found that this concept of resonance also applies to the teaching and learning process. Many teachers (especially math and physics teachers!) tend to forget what it's like to not know the subjects they are teaching, and this creates a disconnect that is frustrating on both sides. Whenever a student is "just not getting it," repeating the same kind of instruction is like pumping your legs out of sync with the swing: things will slow and eventually stop. But if I, as a teacher, can come to understand how the student **is** thinking about a problem (instead of focusing solely on how they **should** be thinking), then I can match the student's "resonant frequency" and amplify their learning. 

Or, to put it simply, effective teaching requires being "on the same wavelength." :D
