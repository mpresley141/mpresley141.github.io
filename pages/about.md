## Teaching

I am an experienced teacher of physics and mathematics, currently working as a private tutor in physics and mathematics for high school and college students. Previously, as a graduate student at UC Berkeley, I taught for many introductory and advanced undergraduate physics courses. 

I also helped lead the Physical Sciences Discipline Cluster of UC Berkeley's bi-annual [GSI Teaching Conference](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/conference/), which prepared incoming graduate students for their first time teaching. 

## Research

My current research interests include integrating our modern understanding of psychology and mental health into best practices for teaching math and science; applying the principles of user-centered and inclusive design to re-think the structure of college courses; and exploring whether a greater emphasis on meta-cognition skills can improve student learning. 

## Education

I have a Masters in Physics from [UC Berkeley](https://physics.berkeley.edu/) and a Bachelors in Astrophysics from [Princeton University](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/).
